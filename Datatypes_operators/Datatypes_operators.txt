5. Develop a Java program that reads a temperature value in Celsius degrees from the keyboard and transforms it to Fahrenheit degrees. The program must print the two values in the form: X Celsius degrees are Y Fahrenheit degrees. 

6. Using only the programming techniques you learned in this lesson, write an application that calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 10 and prints the resulting values in table format, as shown below. 
number square cube 
0               0             0

7. Write a Java program to takes the user for a distance (in meters) and the time taken (as three numbers: hours, minutes, seconds), and display the speed, in meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per hour (hint: 1 mile = 1609 meters). 
 
Test Data
Input distance in meters: 2500 
Input hour: 5 
Input minutes: 56
Input seconds: 23

Expected Output :
Your speed in meters/second is 0.11691531 
Your speed in km/h is 0.42089513 
Your speed in miles/h is 0.26158804
