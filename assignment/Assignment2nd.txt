1. Install required softwares for java application development

2. Write a java class to print a text message in a console

3. write a java method to add two numbers.
2. (Population projection) The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the
following assumptions:
¦ One birth every 7 seconds
¦ One death every 13 seconds
¦ One new immigrant every 45 seconds
Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume
the current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days. Hint: In Java, if
two integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fraction part is truncated.
For example, 5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25) and 10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5).

3. (Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit) Write a program that reads a Celsius degree in a
double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the
result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:
fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32
Hint: In Java, 9 / 5 is 1, but 9.0 / 5 is 1.8.
Here is a sample run:

Enter a degree in Celsius: 43
43 Celsius is 109.4 Fahrenheit
