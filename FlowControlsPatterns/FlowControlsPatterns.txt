control statements and loops

1. (Print a table) Write a program that displays the following table:
a b pow(a, b)
1 2 1
2 3 8
3 4 81
4 5 1024
5 6 15625


3. Write a program that generates two integers under 100
and prompts the user to enter the sum of these two integers. The program then
reports true if the answer is correct, false otherwise.


4. (Game: lottery) Revise Listing 3.9, Lottery.java, to generate a lottery of a threedigit
number. The program prompts the user to enter a three-digit number and
determines whether the user wins according to the following rules:
1. If the user input matches the lottery number in the exact order, the award is
$10,000.
2. If all the digits in the user input match all the digits in the lottery number, the
award is $3,000.
3. If one digit in the user input matches a digit in the lottery number, the award is
$1,000.



5. (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers) Write
a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many
positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and average of
the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0. Display
the average as a floating-point number. Here is a sample run:
Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0:1 2 -1 3 0
The number of positives is 3
The number of negatives is 1
The total is 5
The average is 1.25

or

Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0:
No numbers are entered except 0
0

6.(Display four patterns using loops) Use nested loops that display the following
patterns in four separate programs:
Pattern A        Pattern B  Pattern C    Pattern D
1       	1 2 3 4 5 6       1 	1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2     	1 2 3 4 5       2 1   	  1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3   	1 2 3 4       3 2 1         1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 	1 2 3       4 3 2 1           1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5 	1 2 	  5 4 3 2 1 	    	1 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 	1 	6 5 4 3 2 1 	          1


7.(Occurrence of max numbers) Write a program that reads integers, finds the
largest of them, and counts its occurrences. Assume that the input ends with
number 0. Suppose that you entered 3 5 2 5 5 5 0; the program finds that the
largest is 5 and the occurrence count for 5 is 4.
(Hint: Maintain two variables, max and count. max stores the current max number,
and count stores its occurrences. Initially, assign the first number to max
and 1 to count. Compare each subsequent number with max. If the number is
greater than max, assign it to max and reset count to 1. If the number is equal to
max, increment count by 1.)
Enter numbers:
The largest number is 5
The occurrence count of the largest number is 4
3 5 2 5 5 5 0

8. (Decimal to hex) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer
between 0 and 15 and displays its corresponding hex number. Here are some sample
runs:
Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 11
The hex value is B

Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 5
The hex value is 5

Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 288
Invalid input
